# NQueen
The two programs use two solutions for placing N queens on a chess board and finding the number of moves.
Nqueen1.py: Its code is solved using traditional backtracking.
Nqueen2.py: Its code is a heuristic method with the least-constraining-value to determine the order in which to check in new column assignments.

The command is run by adding arguments such as '--size' '16' after the number of queens. Or just use the configuration in the.vscode file.
